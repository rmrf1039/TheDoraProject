              <p>
                After arriving Kansai International Airport, we first visited the famous Buddhist temple “Kinkakuji (金閣寺／きんかくじ).” Kinkakuji, literally means “the golden pavilion," is officially named “Rokuonji (鹿苑寺／ろくおんじ).” As the name suggests, the main and the most famous pavilion, is covered in gold leaf. Fortunately, we visited Kinkakuji in a sunny day, and saw the
                breathtaking scene that the golden pavilion sparkled in the sunlight. The temple is not opened to the public. You can only walk along the path beside the lake and in the garden to appreciate its appearance. It took us about 20 minutes to stroll around the main pavilion, and an hour in totally for the entire garden.

              <h3 class="mb-5 ps-5">Wagashi (和菓子) handmade experience.</h3>
              <p>In the second day, we came to Yatsuhashian Kakehashi for the wagashi handmade experience. To make this traditional Japanese sweet, you don’t need complicated ingredients or tools. Wagashi is usually made with rice flour, beans, and sugar. The instructor had prepared cooked dough and red bean paste for us. All we had to do was:</p>
              <ol class="p">
                <li>Color the dough with edible pigment.</li>
                <li>Put the red bean paste inside.</li>
                <li>Mold the dough as you like!</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Although it seemed easy to make wagashi, it was actually difficult for one who had no any experience of cooking. The most difficult part was to shape the dough into a beautiful flower or rabbit. Wagashi is not only a dessert, but is also a piece of art that represents the traditional beauty of Japan. Thus, the appearance is as important as its taste.</p>

              <h1>Nara Park</h1>
              <p>In the third day, we visited Nara Park in the next afternoon. Nara Park is known for the wild shika deer in it. The deer there have the most adorable appearance, but in fact, they can be as horrible as the monkey in NSYSU when they see “shika senbei (鹿せんべい)”.</p>
              <p>“Shika senbei,” or deer crackers, is another popular thing in Nara Park. The crackers are sold to tourists to feed the deer. It was a horrible experience that we were under siege by the herd of deer immediately after we got the crackers in hands. At the end, we could only throw out the crackers to escape from them.</p>

              <p>Paper hotpot (紙なべ) was our dinner in the second day. Different from the normal hotpot, the cooking pot they used was made by paper. There were several chances for us to having meals in restaurants, and thus we learned special dining protocol in Japan. First, people in Japan usually wait until everyone gets their dishes and then start eating at the same time. Second, They will say “いただきます” before they start eating, and “ごちそうさま” when they finish the dishes to show their appreciation for the meal and the cook. Third, they don’t use a spoon to eat their miso soup (味噌汁／みそしる), they bring the bowl to their mouth and eat the soup with chopsticks.</p>

              <p>And if you buy food from the food stand on the street, remember that eating while walking is not allowed in Japan to keep the street clean. When we bought the ice cream cones in Kyoto. The shop owner told us that the neighborhood is annoyed by the tourists who eat while they are walking. And this conversation occurred in the following days every time when we tried to get food from a store. But it is fine to drink a canned coffee beside a vender machine. Just remember to stand still while drinking, and throw the can into the garbage can after you finish it.</p>
